        "3. Implement a process to compare the outputs of both models and compute a KL-divergence loss.\n",
        "4. Optimize the custom model's parameters by minimizing the KL-divergence between the two models’ distributions.\n",
        "5. Demonstrate how to evaluate and compare both models on sample data."
