# **Native Sparse Attention (NSA): A Hardware-Aligned and Trainable Sparse Attention Mechanism**

## **Motivation**
Long-context modeling is critical for next-generation language models, powering tasks such as:
- **Complex reasoning** (e.g., multi-hop question answering)
- **Repository-level code generation** (e.g., full-codebase comprehension)
- **Multi-turn dialogue systems** (e.g., chatbot memory over long conversations)

However, **vanilla full attention mechanisms** are computationally expensive due to their **quadratic complexity** in sequence length. Sparse attention methods attempt to reduce this cost but face **significant challenges** in practice.

## **Challenges with Existing Sparse Attention Methods**
### 1. **Lack of Real-World Speedup**
   - Many sparse attention methods claim theoretical speedups but fail to **reduce actual latency** due to **inefficient memory access**.
   - The **key-value (KV) cache memory bottleneck** remains a major constraint in long-sequence processing.
   - Most methods focus on **only one inference phase** (e.g., decoding or pre-filling), limiting full-speed improvements.

### 2. **Incompatibility with Modern Attention Architectures**
   - Recent efficient attention mechanisms, such as **Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and Multiple-Query Attention (MQA)**, optimize memory access.
   - Many sparse methods fail to integrate with these architectures, leading to **high KV-cache access overhead**, negating speed benefits.

### 3. **Post-Hoc Sparsity Hurts Model Performance**
   - Existing methods **apply sparsity after pretraining**, disrupting the **learned attention distribution**.
   - Retrieval-heavy tasks suffer because many important **attention pathways are pruned** arbitrarily.

### 4. **Sparse Attention Is Not End-to-End Trainable**
   - Many approaches introduce **non-trainable components**, such as:
     - **Clustering (e.g., ClusterKV)**, which disrupts gradient flow.
     - **Hashing-based selection (e.g., HashAttention)**, which breaks differentiability.
   - Sparse methods often **fall back to inefficient attention implementations** due to **non-contiguous memory access**.

## **NSA: A Novel Trainable Sparse Attention Mechanism**
NSA (**Native Sparse Attention**) is a **hardware-optimized and end-to-end trainable sparse attention mechanism** that:
- **Reduces computational overhead** through an innovative multi-path attention structure.
- **Balances efficiency and performance** by dynamically selecting important tokens.
- **Integrates seamlessly with modern GPU architectures** (e.g., Tensor Cores).

### **Key Innovation: Hierarchical Sparse Attention**
NSA **reduces per-query computation** by **organizing keys and values into temporal blocks** and processing them through **three distinct attention paths**:

### **1. Compressed Coarse-Grained Tokens (Global Awareness)**
   - Groups tokens into **block-level representations**, significantly reducing the number of key-value pairs.
   - Captures **global context** efficiently by allowing queries to focus on **higher-level token summaries**.
   - Uses a **learnable MLP** to compress each block’s information into a **single representation**, ensuring minimal information loss.

### **2. Selectively Retained Fine-Grained Tokens (Local Precision)**
   - Identifies and retains **only the most relevant tokens** from the full sequence.
   - Uses **blockwise selection** rather than individual token selection to **optimize memory access**.
   - Computes importance scores **based on intermediate attention signals** instead of adding extra computation.
   - **Ensures critical details are not lost** while maintaining sparsity.

### **3. Sliding Window for Local Context (Short-Range Continuity)**
   - Maintains a **fixed-size local window** to capture **recently processed tokens**.
   - Prevents the model from over-relying on compressed representations.
   - Allows smooth adaptation across different tasks **without degrading training stability**.

## **How to Implement NSA**
NSA can be implemented by modifying the standard attention mechanism in transformer-based models.

### **Step 1: Define Sparse Attention Paths**
Modify the attention mechanism to incorporate:
- **Compressed tokens**: Implement token compression via an **MLP-based aggregation function**.
- **Selected tokens**: Introduce a **blockwise top-k selection mechanism**.
- **Sliding window**: Maintain a **fixed-size local memory buffer**.

### **Step 2: Modify the Forward Pass**
Replace standard attention with **multi-path sparse attention**, using:
```python
def nsa_attention(query, key, value, mask, compression_fn, selection_fn, window_size):
    # Step 1: Apply compression
    compressed_k, compressed_v = compression_fn(key, value)

    # Step 2: Select important tokens
    selected_k, selected_v = selection_fn(query, key, value)

    # Step 3: Apply sliding window attention
    local_k, local_v = key[-window_size:], value[-window_size:]

    # Step 4: Compute attention for each component
    attention_compressed = attention(query, compressed_k, compressed_v, mask)
    attention_selected = attention(query, selected_k, selected_v, mask)
    attention_local = attention(query, local_k, local_v, mask)

    # Step 5: Merge outputs using learned gating
    gated_output = (
        gate_compressed * attention_compressed +
        gate_selected * attention_selected +
        gate_local * attention_local
    )
    
    return gated_output
```
